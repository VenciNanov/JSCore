I wrote the program on VS CODE
with Live server extension version 5.5.1
JsConfig:

{
    "typeAcquisition": {
        "include": [
            "jquery",
            "handlebars"
        ]
    }
}

IF any errors with path not found for partials
please put the path for your machine for me locally worked
 but i've seen that for other machines the same paths as the one on mine dont work on them
